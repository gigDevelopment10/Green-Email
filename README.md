# Green Email

<p>With mobile devices becoming an increasingly integral part of our daily lives, the amount of redundant data stored on them has also increased, leading to a significant carbon footprint.For Solution challenge 2023, we are designing ECOGREEN an application that is set to revolutionize the way we think about mobile storage and environmental sustainability. 

Our app prompts users to identify and delete any unnecessary data from their mobile devices, thus reducing carbon emissions and optimizing storage space. In return for their efforts, users will receive coupons that can be redeemed for eco-friendly products, making this app not only environmentally conscious but also socially responsible.
Our goal is to encourage an eco-friendly society, where every individual plays their part in protecting the environment. With our app, users will not only benefit from having more storage space, but also the satisfaction of knowing that they are making a positive impact on the environment.
We believe that our app is not only relevant but also timely, given the growing concerns about the impact of technology on the environment. With this challenge an opportunity, we can create a more sustainable future, with one mobile device at a time.</p>

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## What is Our Problem?
I had to wonder, with all the continuing ecological crisis facing the planet even if every single one of us adopted
these conservation habits was this really gonna be enough to save the world?

It just seemed that there was something more to the story. I thought I was doing everything I could to help the planet.
But then with one's friend's post everything changed. The post sent me to a report online published by the United Nations stating that cows produce more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector. This means that raising cattle produces more greenhouse gases than all cars, trucks, trains, boats, planes combined. Thirteen percent compared to 18 percent for livestock. This is because cows produce a substantial amount of methane from their digestive process. Methane gas from livestock is 25to 100 times more destructive than carbon dioxide from vehicles. But it turns out there's more to climate change than just fossil fuels.

Some people would say the problem isn't really animal agriculture but actually human overpopulation. In 1812, there were 1 billion people on the planet. In 1912, there were 1.5 billion. Then just 100 years later, our population exploded to 7 billion humans. This number is rightly given a great deal of attention but an even more important figure when determining world population is the world's 70 billion farm animals humans raise. The human population drinks 5.2 billion gallons of water every day and eats 21 billion pounds of food. But just the world's 1.5 billion cows alone drink 45 billion gallons of water every day and eat 135 billion pounds of food.

Global food production must increase by 60% by 2050 in order to meet the demands of the growing world population. Yet, more than one third of the food produced today is lost or wasted. Food loss refers to the decrease in edible food mass at the production, post-harvest and processing stages of the food chain, mostly in developing countries. Food waste refers to the discard of edible foods at the retail and consumer levels, mostly in developed countries. This food wastage represents a missed opportunity to improve food security and comes at a steep environmental price.

The financial costs of food wastage are substantial and amount to about USD 1 trillion each year. However, food wastage also causes serious environmental impacts.

I did more research. The U.N. along with other agencies reported not only did livestock play a major role in global warming it is also the leading cause
of resource consumption and environmental degradation destroying the planet today.

## What is Our Solution?
Actually, This is a bazaar app. But this perspective is really wrong about it. We aim to reduce food waste with the Icarus app. Basic foodstuffs that cannot be sold due to economic reasons and whose expiration date has passed continue to be thrown away. The solution is simple: By selling products whose expiration date is approaching at high, discounts both waste will be reduced and the consumer will smile. By selling products with a very close expiration date at a discount, we will both reduce waste and ensure that the consumer is well fed.

For example we have 100 products and 50 of them were sold by the manufacturer and 25 of them were sold by Icarus. Since the rest of the products are not sold, they have to be thrown away. These products can be used for pet food. Pet food and treats can use that otherwise wasted food, or at least some of it. That could reduce the demand from pet food companies for some raw materials or reduce competition between human and pet food streams.  In this phase of production, we aim to reduce it to zero.

LOCAL ACTION, GLOBAL IMPACT

## Why You Should Choose Us?

People want to act, but see that governments are moving too slow and that individual action is too small. By offering a hub for people to unite, we amplify individual impact. At the same time this hub keeps the barrier to act low and the impact immediate. Alone we are a drop in the ocean, together we make waves.

We are Icarus. We will show that solving big problems like climate change, poverty and hunger is possible. Moreover, we will show that helping to solve these problems can be fun, and way easier than people think. We will show that action can be taken by your group of friends, your department of colleagues, or just by you together with strangers. You can make a real impact, make a real change, and have fun doing it.

FEED IT FORWARD

<!-- ABOUT ICARUS -->
## The Story of Icarus Name

The App Name Idea Coming From -> [Iron Maiden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4w2BZXL6Ss)
When I was listening to Iron Maiden's song, I realize this is the song of a mythological characther.

In Greek mythology, Icarus  was the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth. Icarus and Daedalus attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that Daedalus constructed from feathers and wax. Daedalus warns Icarus first of complacency and then of hubris, instructing him to fly neither too low nor too high, lest the sea's dampness clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignores Daedalus’s instructions not to fly too close to the sun, causing the wax in his wings to melt. He tumbles out of the sky, falls into the sea, and drowns. The myth gave rise to the idiom "don't fly too close to the sun".

## Icaria (Team Name)

Icaria, also spelled Ikaria, is a Greek island in the Aegean Sea, 10 nautical miles (19 km) southwest of Samos. According to tradition, it derives its name from Icarus, the son of Daedalus in Greek mythology, who was believed to have fallen into the sea nearby.
