<p>With mobile devices becoming an increasingly integral part of our daily lives, the amount of redundant data stored on them has also increased, leading to a significant carbon footprint.For Solution challenge 2023, we are designing ECOGREEN an application that is set to revolutionize the way we think about mobile storage and environmental sustainability. 

Our app prompts users to identify and delete any unnecessary data from their mobile devices, thus reducing carbon emissions and optimizing storage space. In return for their efforts, users will receive coupons that can be redeemed for eco-friendly products, making this app not only environmentally conscious but also socially responsible.
Our goal is to encourage an eco-friendly society, where every individual plays their part in protecting the environment. With our app, users will not only benefit from having more storage space, but also the satisfaction of knowing that they are making a positive impact on the environment.
We believe that our app is not only relevant but also timely, given the growing concerns about the impact of technology on the environment. With this challenge an opportunity, we can create a more sustainable future, with one mobile device at a time.</p>
