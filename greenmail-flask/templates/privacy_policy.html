    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>Our website, GreenMail, is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This policy explains what
        information we collect and how we use it.</p>
    
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    
    <p>We collect information from users in a variety of ways, including when they visit our website, register on the site,
        and when they use our services. The information we collect may include, but is not limited to, a user's name, email
        address, and other contact information.</p>
    
    <p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, to personalize the user experience, and to
        communicate with users. We may also use the information to send promotional emails or other communications about our
        products or services.</p>
    
    <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    
    <p>We may share or disclose a user's information with third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>With third party service providers who assist us in operating our website or conducting our business</li>
        <li>As required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or court order</li>
        <li>With third parties for the purpose of conducting a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or part of our business
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the security of a user's information. However, no method of data transmission
        or storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of a user's information.</p>
