Dear leader,

*82% of companies employ some form of assessment test in their hiring
process, as per the Talent Board's Candidate Experience Research report.*

Recruiters use these to evaluate candidates’ ability to perform in
real-world situations and test their reasoning and problem-solving skills.

So *how can educational institutions better prepare their students* for
these tests and maintain their competitive advantage?

The answer lies in *leveraging a fully online simulation of pre-employment
hiring tests (psychometric, aptitude, IT/Non-IT domain).* As students are
required to sit for these assessments as the first step of the hiring
process, it is prudent for universities and educational institutes to tie
up with organizations that can provide placement preparation assessments. Get
started!

and background. Working in such an inclusive environment can allow you to
openly express your thoughts and ideas without hesitation, thus enabling
holistic growth both personally and professionally.

about:



*How can working in a diverse and inclusive environment make you more
successful and productive?*

Hi Om Surushe,

You can now choose your channel’s handle.

As a reminder, in most cases, if you already have a  personalized URL

for your channel, we’ve reserved this for you as your handle. If you’re  
happy with that handle then you’re all set. If you want a different handle  
from the one we reserved, you can change it. If you don’t already have a  
personalized URL today, you’ll also be able to choose a handle. Keep in  
mind that handles are unique to each channel, so once a handle has been  
chosen, it can’t be selected by anyone else.

CHOOSE A HANDLE

first year students (currently second year) to showcase their projects
prepared in first year under PBL activity or any individual project.
Along with the price worth Rs 75,000/- , the best ones will get an
opportunity to earn one month internship with companies (our juries) such
as Tata motors, Copper Cloud, Xenstack, Builder Association of India and
many more. Students will also be guided for filling Patent and Copyright so

   submitted automatically.
   15. If the test stops for any technical reasons, it will resume from the
   same location where it was left last (your answers are saved and your time
   is saved).
   16. Disable your antivirus. Especially if your antivirus is Net
   Protector.
   17. If you are *not able *to go to the* Next or Previous *question*,
   check your internet connection*. The problem is in your network/internet.

 It's Thursday, and you know what that means! Here's a list of the stuff we shipped during the past weeks: 
 
 Lifecycle Jobs 
 In this repository, Romaric shows you several ways you can use Lifecycle Jobs, which include: 
 - Call HTTP endpoint when an Environment is created 
- Create and Destroy an AWS RDS instance with Terraform 
- Create and Destroy an AWS Lambda with Serverless 
- Create and Destroy an AWS EC2 instance with Pulumi 
 Lifecycle jobs run on a Kubernetes cluster and are executed only when a specified event occurs in the environment. The output files created by the job will be automatically set as environment variables for services within the same environment. These types of jobs are useful for tasks such as seeding a database or creating external resources not natively managed by Qovery. 
 Qovery allows you to create and deploy jobs from Git Repository or Container Registry. 
 [Image ""6f5f8b38-8dff-4c63-bf90-1650059094eb_Screenshot+2023-01-03+at+16.19.36.png?auto=compress,format""] 
 
 
 Cronjobs 
 Alessandro, Lead Product Manager at Qovery, joined me during our November Demo Day to talk about Cronjobs, as it was highly expected by most of you. While the development of this feature just started then, I have the honour to inform you that Cronjobs are now available! 🤩 
 A cronjob is a type of workload that runs on a Kubernetes cluster on a regular schedule. It can be used to execute tasks on a regular basis, such as pulling data from an external service every hour or processing data in a database. Qovery allows users to create and deploy Cronjobs from either a Git repository or a container registry. 
 To know more about it, check out our documentation!

 You can reply to this email with thoughts/feedback on the changes we're making, or even better, join us on our Discord!

Recession has hit hard & only 10% of companies are going to hire from your
batch.

Only 2 months to go for your off-campus placements followed by on-campus
placements.

Me & my peers working at Superdream companies like Amazon, VMware, Akamai
etc have come up with this initiative to shortlist a few deserving students
from each college & not only personally train them but also provide
referrals of top MNCs as well.

Checkout the platforms that we created for the ones who get shortlisted:-

We are conducting a google meet to brief you about the details &
shortlisting process. To attend the meet join :-

If you are not yet serious about placements at these tough times of
recession, avoid joining the group.

Dear om,

Finding a job straight after graduation might seem to be a difficult
task. However, with AMCAT, the journey to your dream job
becomes a lot
easier; just like it did with Abhishek.

""AMCAT has provided me with detailed feedback based on the performance
and areas I need to improve on. I've focused on those areas where I
lag,"" Abhishek shared.

And, much like him, you too can find your dream job with AMCAT. Do you
want to learn more about Abhishek's story? Dive right in
.

Success Can Be Yours

The *Hackathon is LIVE as we speak*, I insist you to *extend this
Invitation to your Startup Network and students today itself*, so they can
start working towards their Ideations & Pitches for SEBI.


Contrary to a Typical Hackathon, This Datathon will happen in 2 Steps -

           Step 1: Idea Submission

           Step 2: Shortlisted Teams will Pitch their ideations to* SEBI
Jury.*
[image: main poster sebi.jpg]


The Datathon aims at providing a solution for the following finance-related
issues:

   - Visualisation of Performance
   - Forecasting trends


Winners will be getting a* chance to work with SEBI *and its advisory
committee, and will also receive Cash Prizes worth up to Rs 1.75 Lakhs


*Please add your Logo(s)* to the bottom right as shown in the sample
and *circulate
the same* amongst your start-up networks and students.

Call for Code Fair Work Case Competition
 Uniting students to design solutions for a sustainable and equitable global economic future.

How can technology address the challenge of making decent job creation, entrepreneurship, and fair, sustainable labor a lifelong opportunity of economic growth for all?

On October 6, Call for Code, presented by IBM and the Clinton Global Initiative University, will launch the 2022 Call for Code Fair Work Case Competition. The competition calls on collegiate-level students around the world to imagine innovative solutions that advances the future of work.

The challenge will run October 6-20, 2022 and asks both non-technical and technical university-level student teams to devise innovative business cases that can advance inclusive, scalable workforce development. The competition theme is inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 8 https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8. Solutions should address one of the diverse challenges aligned to this theme and demonstrate how technology can help communities in need. While solution submissions do not need to include working code, teams will need to describe the technologies required and how those technologies fit into the solution. 

Answer the call

As current students, the world needs your expertise, empathy, and unique perspective. Get mentored by entrepreneurs, technologists, and leaders during the competition. Network with other university students from around the world, and compete for prizes from a total pool of $22,000 USD, which includes a $12,000 USD grand prize!

Register for the Case Competition today and help design the fair work of the future.

Intel Technologies takes immense pleasure in welcoming the 1st Year & 2nd
Year CS/IT/ECE/IS students of your institute to be a part of the Intel ""AI
for Youth"" Bootcamp starting this Oct 14th, 2022.


Why AI for Youth?

Today’s students are tomorrow’s innovators. While the impact of Emerging
Technologies like AI is undeniable, the degree to which it influences and
prepares youth is immeasurable. Thus, even though AI is everywhere, the
opportunity to benefit from it and shape it is not.

The next generation of innovators needs the right skills and resources to
understand what AI is, how it is designed, and
why it is important in today’s digital world. Otherwise, the digital skills
gap will only increase and further hurt economies
and society. Moreover, many young people don’t yet fully grasp the key role
they can play in shaping AI.

Hence, it is essential to demystify and democratize AI for the next
generation of innovators in an inclusive way,
irrespective of gender, ethnicity or location.

Providing them the opportunity to learn AI skills and apply them
responsibly to design any solution is an important key
to building long-term competitiveness.
